## Data Science Tools

| Tool               | Description                            |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Jupyter Notebooks  | Interactive data analysis environment. |
| RStudio            | IDE for R.                             |
| Apache Spark       | Distributed data processing engine.    |
| Tableau            | Data visualization tool.               |

## Examples of Arithmetic Expressions
Below are examples of basic arithmetic operations like multiplication and addition.

# Multiply two numbers
product = 3 * 4
# Add two numbers
sum_result = 5 + 9
product, sum_result

# Convert 200 minutes to hours
minutes = 200
hours = minutes / 60
hours

## Objectives
- Learn to use Jupyter Notebooks
- Practice basic arithmetic operations
- Familiarize with data science tools
